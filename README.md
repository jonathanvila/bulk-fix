1. set the parameters including severity and folder
2. specifying a folder will make the app to retrieve all issues in that folder and below
3. get the issues
4. the grid will fill with only the issues that have CodeFix available
5. we can open the selected issue in the SonarQube instance configured
6. we can export those issues in the grid and the app will generate 2 files with a name using the params and the prefix set 
7. these 2 files are a JSON and a CSV
